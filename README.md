# Real-time 2D viscous flow simulation
The purpose of this small code is to simulate fluid-like motion by solving simplified 2D low-resolution Navier-Stoke equations for incompressible/viscous fluids in real-time. 

By taking advantage of the semi Lagrangian method, we can easily visualize the motion of virtual test particles in the fluid.
